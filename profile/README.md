# About

The College of Forestry at Oregon State University is ranked one of the best forestry schools in the world in terms of research dollars and the breadth of academic programs available to students. Sound scientific practice is a core value of the college and training the next generation of scientists in best practices for study design, data collection and analysis, and programming is a top priority. The college therefore employs a full-time statistical consultant available to students, faculty, and staff of the College of Forestry free of charge. Consultations can occur at any stage of a project, from the design phase to the communication of findings in a thesis or manuscript, but is highly encouraged early in the design phase and throughout a research project.
